to run the database code: 
  1. download the database and the .csv files (excel sheets).
  2. at the bottom of the database code you need to copy the paths of each .csv file and past it in its corresponding line of code.
  4. make sure the path looks similar to this:
               'C:\\Users\\lamya\\Desktop\\testing\\allergy.csv'
           with one quoutation mark on each side anddouble slashes instead of ones. 
  5. run the whole code then you can select which table you would like to view by running the specific line the table is viewed in. 
            for example, running this line will only display the allergy table:
                SELECT * FROM allergy;
